# COACH - Comprehensive Orchestration And Configuration Hub
COACH is a powerful, flexible, and extensible tool designed for configuration management and orchestration. Inspired by Ansible, COACH allows you to define and execute configuration tasks using a variety of configuration formats, including TOML, YAML, and CUE. While COACH is primarily designed for Windows environments, it can also be used for Unix/Linux systems.

### Features

- <b>Multiple Configuration Formats</b>: Define your plays in TOML, YAML, or CUE.
- <b>CLI-Based</b>: Fully functional CLI tool with GUI development underway.
- <b>Versatile Protocol Support</b>: Execute tasks over SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and WMI.
- <b>Windows Focused</b>: Optimized for Windows environments, with support for Unix/Linux systems.
- <b>Open Source and Community Driven</b>: Contributions from the developer community are highly encouraged.

### Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coach.git
    cd coach

Build the project:
    
    cargo build --release

Add the binary to your PATH:

    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/coach/target/release

### Usage

To execute a playbook, use the following command:

    coach run -f /path/to/playbook.toml

COACH currently supports TOML, YAML, and CUE formats for playbooks. The format will be inferred from the file extension.

### Example Playbook (TOML)
    [playbook]
    name = "Example Playbook"

    [tasks]
    [tasks.task1]
    name = "Update and Upgrade"
    command = "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y"

    [tasks.task2]
    name = "Install NGINX"
    command = "sudo apt-get install nginx -y"

### Example Playbook (YAML)
    playbook:
    name: "Example Playbook"

    tasks:
    task1:
        name: "Update and Upgrade"
        command: "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y"

    task2:
        name: "Install NGINX"
        command: "sudo apt-get install nginx -y"

### Example Playbook (CUE)
    playbook: {
        name: "Example Playbook"

        tasks: {
            task1: {
                name: "Update and Upgrade"
                command: "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y"
            }

            task2: {
                name: "Install NGINX"
                command: "sudo apt-get install nginx -y"
            }
        }
    }
